This project has some samples to understand Envoy proxy. You can go to <file>.md files to learn. 

### Some helper commands
Get the admin UI - if configured
```
http://localhost:9902/
```

  ### A working sample
  ```brew install envoy ```
  
  Try the "003_first_listener.yaml" -> it works and http://localhost:10000 loads "https://www.envoyproxy.io/"
